* Willpower is not simply self-control.  Self-control is the ability to say yes or no to something intentionally.  Willpower is self-control combined with the ability to remember your long-term goals and use your self-control to act accordingly and do the 'harder' thing.

* Willpower and self-control are thought to have developed through the need for humans to co-exist peacefully in societies in order to enhance the survivability of the entire group (and hence the entire species).  A great deal of this centers around maintaining long-term relationships with other humans.

* Willpower is more correlated with almost every desirable attribute a human can have than the more intuitive components.  For example, relationship length is more strongly correlated with willpower than empathetic response, and willpower is more strongly correlated with career success than intelligence.

* The prefrontal cortext is where the majority of neural pathways that are responsible for self-control and self-guidance dwell.  The ability to say yes, no, and remember what you want are all three divided portions of the prefrontal cortex.  (And I assume since these neural circuits are fairly specific and modular, they can be strengthened and weakened for specific purposes like any other)

* The story of Phineas Gage, who lost his prefrontal cortex in an accident, is one where a human completely lost its willpower and self-control by a (very drastic) change of neural circuitry.

* Willpower is a balancing act against the desire for immediate gratification.Essentially a tug-of-war between reptilian and mammalian brain (a very simple model...), in which both evolved to serve a specific purpose and are appropriate for facing certain challenges.  Modern times seem to require more mammalian brain than reptilian, however.

* Not every part of the reptilian brain is bad for us.  Primitive instincts furthered the species for a long time, and still serve a very important purpose in an intentional life.  Losing these instincts and create a lack of desire (and depression) in life, for which the need for a prefrontal cortex is obviated.  Willpower allows us to utilize our desires to further our goals and steer them away from instinctive behavior when it would harm them.

* The other important component of our mind: self-awareness.  Self-awareness allows us to reflect and realize when we are acting via willpower or instinct.This gives us the chance to intervene when we see that we are utilizing the wrong one.  Often, self-awareness can even allow us to predict how we will respond to certain temptations, giving us ample time to prepare a response or avoid the temptation altogether.

* Distraction is a split (or drop) in our self-awareness.  By being distracted, we reduce our ability to effectively intervene with our impulses.  For me, being distracted is very common.  At work I am distracted by home, at home I am distracted by work, and in between I am distracted by gadgets and entertainment.  It is no wonder I feel that I am underserving all these areas of my life.
