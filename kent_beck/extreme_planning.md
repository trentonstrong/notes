## Extreme Planning - Chapter 1 - Why Plan?

- Plans allow us to operate rationally and not succumb to panic under change and unpredictable events.

- Plans can also cause problems when used improperly.  Plans can be used to conceal problems, give a false sense of control, and use up disproportionate resources that could be allocated to development.

### Why We Should Plan

- In order to plan a project effectively one must understand the goals of the project clearly.  Goals need to be specific and concrete in order to be measurable.

- Plans serve the purpose of:

  * Prioritizing by importance the things we need to do so we can work on the most important thing

  * Act as the substrate for team / stakeholder communication and collaboration about what to do.

  * Give an understanding of how unexpected events change the relative importance of things to do, coordinate and distribute the new information.

- Time is the scarcest resource, and is expended on work on one item at the mutual exclusion of other items.

- Planning relies on estimates.  Estimates are often inaccurate and are *always* secondary to actuals.

- In order for a plan to be effective, one must change the plan as soon as the effect of new information is known.  It can then be coordinated with others.

### What We Need In Planning

- Planning occurs at different time scales and different organizational scales.  Plans are fractal in nature and choosing the granularity of planning is important (planning for every step of a walk around the park is not helpful).

- Planning requires measurable milestones in order to provide a reference frame for progress within the plan.  Software is inherently abstract and makes this difficult.  Without a reference frame people feel uncomfortable and unable to find their bearings (both team and stakeholders).

- Planning should *add* visibility so that *everyone* involved with the project can see the progress.  Milestones need to clearly represent progress to *everyone* so they can be understood and trusted.

- Plans need to be simple to build and easy to update.  Complex plans that require too much effort to change are not cost effective.  Simple plans are easily understood by everyone involved.

- Plans need to be honest and include all information available.  Plans should make it more difficult, not easier, to be fooled by inconsequential progress.

### The Planning Trap

- Planning can give a false sense of control over events.  Events are not under our control, only our reactions.  Events *change* plans.

- A complicated plan can hide its disagreement with reality, and often the planner wants to appear to be in control and is motivated to keep up the illusion that things are going according to plan.

- A plan that diverges from reality and is not changed accordingly will cause problems.  Developers will lose morale.  Outside parties depending on the plan will not have the latest information and will base their plans on false data.

- The worst possible thing that can happen to a plan is divergence from reality.  Honest plans continually change.

## Extreme Planning - Chapter 2 - Fear

- Process around building software helps to mitigate fear.

- Fear comes from both sides: customer and developer.

- Customer fears:
  * Deliverable will not be what was required.

  * They will improperly specify the deliverable.

  * Deliverable will cost too much.

  * Developers aren't invested in the project as much as stakeholders.

  * Development will not be transparent about plans.

  * Plans shared will be fictitious.

  * They won't understand technical details or impediments.

  * They will be held to all their decisions and unable to react to business changes.

  * Developers will not be trustworthy.

- Developer fears:

  * Will be given too much work to do in a reasonable amount of time.

  * Will be given requirements that don't make sense or are too vague.

  * Will be unable to achieve requirements because solution is too difficult.

  * Will be held responsible without authority to make project work.

  * Will have to sacrifice engineering quality in order to meet timelines.

  * Will have to solve difficult problems without enough expertise or assistance.

  * Will not have enough time to make project succeed.

### Unacknowledged Fear is the Source of All Software Project Failures

- Unacknowledged fears result in defense mechanisms.  An unacknowledged fear will not be dealt with, but will be avoided and hidden until it is too late.

- Witholding communication based on expectations of an undesired response will always cause problems.

- Customers and developers have rights within any collaborative development process.

### Customer Bill of Rights

- You have the right to an overall plan, to know what can be accomplished when and at what cost.

- You have the right to get the most possible value out of every programming week.

- You have the right to see progress in a running system, proven to work by passing
repeatable tests that you specify.

- You have the right to change your mind, to substitute functionality, and to change
priorities without paying exorbitant costs.

- You have the right to be informed of schedule changes, in time to choose how to reduce the scope to restore the original date.  You can cancel at any time and be left with a useful working system reflecting investment to date.

### Programmer Bill of Rights

- You have the right to know what is needed, with clear declarations of priority.

- You have the right to produce quality work at all times.

- You have the right to ask for and receive help from peers, managers, and
customers.

- You have the right to make and update your own estimates.

- You have the right to accept your responsibilities instead of having them assigned
to you.



- Good development requires a culture that acknowledges fears and uncertainties and communicates about them.  (Painful truths!)

- Once fear is acknowledged, responsibilities and ownership can be taken.  Only then can offensive action be taken.

- Defensive fear-based process is rooted in control, and slows down the entire development effort.

- Offensive process enables setting goals that are difficult to achieve and striving to achieve them as a team.  Offensive process does only what is required to get the work done in an order from most important to least important.
