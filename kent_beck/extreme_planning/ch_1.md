## Extreme Planning - Chapter 1 - Why Plan?

- Plans allow us to operate rationally and not succumb to panic under change and unpredictable events.

- Plans can also cause problems when used improperly.  Plans can be used to conceal problems, give a false sense of control, and use up disproportionate resources that could be allocated to development.

### Why We Should Plan

- In order to plan a project effectively one must understand the goals of the project clearly.  Goals need to be specific and concrete in order to be measurable.

- Plans serve the purpose of:

  * Prioritizing by importance the things we need to do so we can work on the most important thing

  * Act as the substrate for team / stakeholder communication and collaboration about what to do.

  * Give an understanding of how unexpected events change the relative importance of things to do, coordinate and distribute the new information.

- Time is the scarcest resource, and is expended on work on one item at the mutual exclusion of other items.

- Planning relies on estimates.  Estimates are often inaccurate and are *always* secondary to actuals.

- In order for a plan to be effective, one must change the plan as soon as the effect of new information is known.  It can then be coordinated with others.

### What We Need In Planning

- Planning occurs at different time scales and different organizational scales.  Plans are fractal in nature and choosing the granularity of planning is important (planning for every step of a walk around the park is not helpful).

- Planning requires measurable milestones in order to provide a reference frame for progress within the plan.  Software is inherently abstract and makes this difficult.  Without a reference frame people feel uncomfortable and unable to find their bearings (both team and stakeholders).

- Planning should *add* visibility so that *everyone* involved with the project can see the progress.  Milestones need to clearly represent progress to *everyone* so they can be understood and trusted.

- Plans need to be simple to build and easy to update.  Complex plans that require too much effort to change are not cost effective.  Simple plans are easily understood by everyone involved.

- Plans need to be honest and include all information available.  Plans should make it more difficult, not easier, to be fooled by inconsequential progress.

### The Planning Trap

- Planning can give a false sense of control over events.  Events are not under our control, only our reactions.  Events *change* plans.

- A complicated plan can hide its disagreement with reality, and often the planner wants to appear to be in control and is motivated to keep up the illusion that things are going according to plan.

- A plan that diverges from reality and is not changed accordingly will cause problems.  Developers will lose morale.  Outside parties depending on the plan will not have the latest information and will base their plans on false data.

- The worst possible thing that can happen to a plan is divergence from reality.  Honest plans always change.
